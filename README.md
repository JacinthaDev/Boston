# My Awesome Project
This is my mock-up version of the Boston newspaper website. I flexed my knowledge of CSS and layout to create this project.

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS

I put to use my knowledge of semantic HTML & CSS. CSS was the real challenge here, as I dove deep into the box model and layout and leanred how different elements behave together. Using flexbox could have been an easier way to design this mockup, but floats really provided me with an intimate understanding of web design.

## Lessons Learned:
This was my first project practicing CSS layout. I didn't quite yet know to think of everything on the page as a box. I had my first experience with the box model and floating elements.
